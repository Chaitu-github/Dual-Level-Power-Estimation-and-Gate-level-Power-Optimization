# Dual-Level-Power-Estimation-and-Gate-level-Power-Optimization
•	Obtained SAIF from VCD file and estimated logic level and gate level power using synopsis       power compiler.
•	Optimized gate level power by setting power constraints in Synopsys Design Compiler.
•	Reduced leakage power by implementing multi threshold voltage libraries.
•	Incorporated clock gating to optimize dynamic power by using clock gated cell libraries.
